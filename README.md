# Lab 03 - Nobel Laureates Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of Nobel laureates data, inspired by a 2017 Buzzfeed article about the importance of immigration for American science. The analysis explores the relationship between Nobel laureates, their country of origin, and where they were based when they won their prizes.

## Overview

The analysis focuses on:
- Living Nobel laureates in Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics
- The proportion of US-based Nobel laureates
- The birth countries of US-based Nobel laureates
- Visualizations supporting the analysis using ggplot2

## Data

The dataset (`nobel.csv`) contains information about Nobel laureates including:
- Personal information (name, gender, birth/death dates)
- Prize information (year, category, motivation)
- Geographic information (country of birth, country when winning)
